# Memory Consolidation in Simple Games by Deep-Q Forward-Forward Learning
This is the repository for the RUG bachelor's thesis on Forward-Forward learning and it's extension to the field of reinforcement learning. 

The research starts with creating gameplay data from blackjack using the optimal strategy. Various types of Forward-Forward Neural Networks are subsequently trained using this data. Lastly, an adaptation of the Forward-Forward algorithm is introduced, called deep-Q Forward-Forward Learning. This algorithm uses a Forward-Forward Neural Network as a function approximator in reinforcement learning.

The code can be exectuted by running the `FFNN_blackjack.ipynb` jupyter notebook. Beware of the significant runtime.
